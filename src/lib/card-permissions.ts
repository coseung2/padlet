/**
 * Card-level permission primitives for role-model-cleanup.
 *
 * Identity × ownership → capabilities. Pure functions with no I/O so they
 * can be called from server components, API routes, and (if needed) from
 * client components that already have the identity object in hand.
 *
 * The legacy BoardMember.role enum (`owner|editor|viewer`) is being
 * retired — it couldn't express "student is editor of their own card but
 * viewer of others'" because role was single-valued. See
 * `tasks/2026-04-15-role-model-cleanup/phase1/research.md` for the
 * motivation.
 *
 * Multi-identity: predicates accept `Identities` (the per-request bundle
 * of every signed-in credential) and OR across all three paths. A teacher
 * who is ALSO a parent of a student in another classroom no longer has
 * their parent path masked by the teacher precedence.
